# receiptRecorder


This project keeps track of unplanned expenses by taking photo of the paper receipts. The user takes a photo of the paper receipts and the app extracts the store name and amount paid from the photo and stores it as a record on phone. Further, the app also lets its users analyse their total expenses per month, per year or compare it with previous months/years in a bar chart format. 

This app can be used by anyone for their personal expenses however it is aimed towards managers/event_coordinators to keep track of their team event expenses without having to hold on to the receipts.
